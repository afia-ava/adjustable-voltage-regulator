# adjustable-voltage-regulator

## Description
It is a kind of voltage stabilized power supply composed of LM317 chip, which has the simplest form of fixed three-terminal voltage stabilized circuit and has the feature of adjustable output voltage.  
Input Voltage：AC 110V  
Output voltage：DC 1.25V~12V（continuously adjustable）  
Output Current：200 MA  
Can be used as a small power supply, signal generator, logic signal tester，Sensor alarm has buzzer function, such as soil moisture alarm, temperature alarm, etc.

## Journal 
Today, I soldered the voltage regulator circuit. It was by far the most complicated circuit I soldered. The timer component didn't had holes in the circuit so I had to add extra wires, and glue down the timer component. I'll still need to connect this to the power cables later.
